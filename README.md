# Open-Source Collective Constitutional AI (CCAI)

## Overview

Open-Source CCAI is a tool that enables anyone to train an AI model based on a constitution created from collective input. This project aims to democratize the process of aligning AI systems with human values and preferences.

## Process

1. Constitution Creation: Gather collective input from a diverse group of participants.
2. Input Transformation: Convert collective feedback into a set of principles (constitution).
3. Model Training: Fine-tune an AI model using the created constitution.
4. Sharing: Store Constitutions and trained models in a publicly navigable digital library.

## Goals

- Empower communities to create AI models aligned with their values
- Increase transparency in AI alignment processes
- Explore scalable methods for incorporating public input into AI development
