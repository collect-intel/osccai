# Open-Source Collective Constitutional AI (CCAI)

## Overview

Open-Source CCAI is a tool that enables anyone to train an AI model based on a constitution created from collective input. This project aims to democratize the process of aligning AI systems with human values and preferences.

## Process

1. Constitution Creation: Gather collective input from a diverse group of participants.
2. Input Transformation: Convert collective feedback into a set of principles (constitution).
3. Model Training: Fine-tune an AI model using the created constitution.
4. Sharing: Store Constitutions and trained models in a publicly navigable digital library.

## Goals

- Empower communities to create AI models aligned with their values
- Increase transparency in AI alignment processes
- Explore scalable methods for incorporating public input into AI development

## Components

- ðŸ“„Constitution Creator
- ðŸ’ªModel Trainer (from a Constitution)
- ðŸ“šConstitution Library

## Overview

Project / Tool: **Open-Source CCAI** **[OS CCAI]** consists of
* **Collective Constitution Creator**
* **(Model Training) **
* **Collective Constitution Library**

**Creators** use the **Collective Constitution Creator** platform to generate **Constitutions** from collective input gathered in a **Poll**.

Using this tool creates a new **Poll** that collects **Statements**.

**Participants** interact with the Poll to **Vote** on othersâ€™ Statements.

Votes take the form of **Agree, Disagree, **or **Pass**. Participants can also **Flag** a Statement for removal (inappropriate/off-topic).
